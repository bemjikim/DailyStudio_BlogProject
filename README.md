+ ## About

The Millennial and Gen Z generations prefer to document their daily lives in a small and casual manner, such as through blogging. On their blogs, they can express their emotions honestly, which they may not easily reveal on social media. They also utilize blogs for the purpose of keeping a diary. People record their daily lives in various ways, such as the "life in one shot" concept or "photism," where they capture a day with a single photo. With the increasing interest in documenting life, among students and professionals, we aim to create an application that allows users to record and preserve the moments they want to remember every day.

- ## Concept

#### "Capturing the Moments of a Day"
Inspired by a photography studio that captures the essence of the present moment, we want to create a small blog app with a photography studio concept. We aimed to depict the act of writing a blog post as if taking a photo at a photography studio. Similarly, we wanted to represent the act of preserving posts as printing photos at a photography studio to create lasting memories.  
  
-----------------
- ## Functionality
 
Our DailyStudio BlogProject will include the following key features:

Membership Registration: Users can create an account to have their personal diary.
Post Creation: Users can write blog posts using photos and text, capturing their daily moments (including create, read, update, delete operations - CRUD).
Bookmarking: Users can save their most precious moments separately, making them easily accessible.
Storage and Organization: The app provides a user-friendly interface to browse and organize posts by year and month, allowing users to view their memories at a glance.
